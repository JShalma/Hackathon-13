🌿 Formelle ~ A Personalized Ingredient Checker 
  Formelle is a web application that helps users understand what’s really in their skincare and haircare products. Withough having to go on google and research about it, Formelle provides hands-on information about everything you need to know about the safety of the cosmetic/hygiene products youre using. 
  By analyzing ingredient lists against a curated chemical database, Formelle offers transparent, science-backed insights on safety, origin, and environmental impact, tailored to your personal concerns.

  Inspiration✨
  
  In a world where beauty labels promise “clean,” “natural,” or “dermatologist-approved,” consumers are often left confused by ingredient lists filled with scientific jargon. We wanted to change that.
  Formelle was born from the idea that science should empower, not intimidate. Our team set out to build a tool that translates complex cosmetic chemistry into clear, human language, helping users understand how each ingredient affects their skin, health, and the environment.
  We envision Formelle as the bridge between scientific transparency and everyday beauty choices, guiding people toward products that truly align with their values and needs.
