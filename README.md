  <h3>⭐️ Motto: "Beauty. Defined by science" ⭐️
 
  ------------------------------

  <h2>Inspiration✨</h2>
  
  In a world where beauty labels promise “clean,” “natural,” or “dermatologist-approved” products, consumers are often left confused by ingredient lists filled with scientific jargon. We wanted to change that.
  Formelle was born from the idea that science should empower, not intimidate. Our team set out to build a tool that translates complex cosmetic chemistry into clear, human language, helping users understand how each ingredient affects their skin, health, and the environment.
  We envision Formelle as the bridge between scientific transparency and everyday beauty choices, guiding people toward products that truly align with their values and needs. Beyond just regualar people, Formelle can be very useful for very useful for dermatologists, cosmetic chemists, skincare brands, and sustainability researchers who need quick, organized insights into ingredient safety, sourcing, and environmental impact. It can also assist regulatory professionals and product developers in ensuring formulations meet clean beauty standards and consumer transparency expectations.


  <h2>How We Built It ⚙️ </h2>

Frontend: HTML + Tailwind CSS for a modern, elegant, and responsive design

Backend: Flask (Python) for server-side logic, routing, and data rendering

Database: A single JSON file (data.json) containing detailed ingredient information — including descriptions, sources, health safety, environmental impact, and fragrance or pregnancy safety indicators


  <h2>Features 💻</h2>

  - Upload or paste product ingredient lists
  
  - Select personal concerns/targets (e.g., acne-prone, eco-friendly, sensitive skin)
  
  - Get detailed chemical breakdowns with origin, human safety, and environmental impact
  
  - Tailwind-powered design for speed and accessibility
  
  - Expandable to include AI-driven ingredient parsing and product scoring
    

<h2>Future Improvements!💪🏼</h2>

- Integrate a Generative AI model for intelligent ingredient parsing and personalized recommendations
  
- Build a database API for real-time updating chemical information retrieval
  
- Add visual dashboards to compare ingredient safety scores
  
- Launch a mobile version for on-the-go beauty scanning
  
- Deploy fully on AWS with user authentication and profiles


<h2>Challenges we overcame! 🧩</h2>

- Designing a scalable Flask backend under time constraints

- Structuring and cleaning raw JSON datasets
    - structuring chemical data in an efficient and readable format

- Achieving a cohesive, professional design without external CSS libraries

- connecting the backend and frontend smoothly through Flask routes
